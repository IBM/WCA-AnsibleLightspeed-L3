[6 min] i. Automation is indispensable to modern IT strategy Despite the innovations and advancements made in the domain of automation, IBM sellers and partners know first-hand from discussions with clients that many businesses are still struggling to keep up with their IT operations. The rapid pace of technological innovation\u2014 in particular, areas such as AI and machine learning \u2014are obviously challenging for any organization to strategize and plan around. But smaller, more practical challenges also stand in the way of these businesses. The fact remains that IT operations, and wrangling those operations in an efficient and streamlined manner, remains a difficult problem to solve. Three primary pain points that IBM consistently hears from the marketplace include: an ever-increasing skills gap in IT management; that Day 2 operations continue to be labor-intensive, mostly manual endeavors; and that the complexity of the systems needing to be managed are out-pacing many organization\u2019s ability to adapt. All of these pain points are potential automation challenges to be solved. Each of them impedes a company's ability to move quickly and adapt for the future. And as such, for many IBM clients, solving these automation challenges have become an indispensable element in their strategy to modernize IT. UNPRECEDENTED RATE OF GENERATIVE AI ADOPTION Even though generative AI is relatively new, the widespread popularity of ChatGPT has created significant interest in the notion of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs) \u2014 and what they can do for business. It took quite some time for enterprises to start moving toward traditional AI. In contrast, generative AI has experienced massive early adoption: 80% of enterprises are already working with, or planning to leverage FMs, and plan to adopt generative AI in their use cases and workflow. Moreover, the following data points to an ever-growing adoption trend for generative AI: Scale Zeitgeist 2023 AI Readiness Report notes that with the companies they reviewed, 21% have generative AI models in production; 29% are experimenting with generative AI and another 31% are planning to work with generative AI models; a total of 81% are either working with or planning to work with generative AI models Goldman Sachs has estimated that generative AI will have a very deep economic impact \u2013 raising global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 7% within 10 years, reflecting the technology\u2019s huge potential. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) noted that generative AI is expected to represent 30% of the overall market by 2025 ii. Generative AI-assisted code lifecycle management achieves what LLMs alone cannot Following the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, the marketplace has been awash with competing large language model (LLM) and generative AI-based assists. It's one thing to train and deploy an LLM; it's another thing entirely to make it applicable and tangibly beneficial for business. What separates IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) offerings from competing vendors in the marketplace? The design and implementation of WCA is purposely built to assist, using generative AI, software and code lifecycle management. In short, generative AI-assisted code lifecycle management helps to achieve what large language models cannot achieve on their own. It is what distinguished WCA from other code assistants in the marketplace today. Code lifecycle management begins with understanding client code, through training across a myriad of programming languages and specializations in paradigms such as Ansible Automation Platform, and applies that understanding across a client\u2019s application and runtime environments. Users are able to plan next steps based on generative AI analysis of their existing application code. Operations teams can rapidly transform their codebases with optimized design and architecture that is recommended according to IBM Granite's best-practice models. Administrators can validate the outcomes with automatically generated unit tests. Afterwards, they can deploy those services and applications using automated processes like Ansible's automation engine. Over the course of that application or code's lifecycle, generative AI can maintain healthy operations with runtime insights. iii. Introducing the IBM watsonx Code Assistant product family IBM watsonx Code Assistant is the flagship offering in a suite of generative AI code assistant products, which also include offerings for Ansible Automation Platform (IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed) and IBM Systems modernization (IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z). The solution accelerates software development tasks with AI-powered capabilities including context-aware code generation, explanation, documentation, translation, and unit test generation. It does so while maintaining the principles of trust, security, and compliance with regards to IBM client's data and intellectual property. Developers and IT Operators can utilize WCA to speed up application modernization efforts and generate Ansible-based automation jobs to rapidly scale out (or scale up) IT environments. IBM watsonx Code Assistant products are powered by IBM Granite foundation models that include state-of-the-art large language models designed for code. For offerings such as WCA for Ansible Lightspeed and WCA for Z, bespoke code models\u2014 tailored to working with Ansible Automation Platform and COBOL-to-Z use cases, respectively \u2014are invoked. Universally true for all of the watsonx Code Assistant offerings is that they are geared towards helping IT teams create high-quality code using AI-generated recommendations, based on natural language requests or existing source code. These AI models, and the recommendations they generate, are seamlessly integrated via extensions with the world's most popular developer integrated development environments (IDE), including Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. Granite is IBM\u2019s flagship brand of open and proprietary LLMs, spanning multiple modalities. Granite models exist for code, languages, time series, and GeoSpatial \u2014 with additional modalities expected in future. IBM Granite code models are a series of decoder-only models for code generative tasks, trained with code written in 116 different programming languages. The Granite code models family consists of models ranging in size from 3 to 34 billion parameters, in both a base model and instruction-following model variants. These models have a range of uses, from complex application modernization tasks to on-device memory-constrained use cases. The larger the block size for a particular language on this chart, the larger percentage of training corpus data of that language was used to train the Granite code model. Languages and formats such as Java, C, JSON, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP are subjects in which the model \u201cMajors\u201d and excels. Other languages such as Ruby, SQL, and Swift could be considered \u201cMinors\u201d where the generalized code model can work with the language, but has less training data to base those recommendations on. These percentages and training data volumes will continue to evolve as the Granite code models mature. WATSONX CODE ASSISTANT vs. WCA FOR ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED? For those familiar with other IBM watsonx Code Assistant offerings\u2014 such as WCA for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and WCA for Z \u2014the generalized code model approach, as seen here, differs from the specialized code model approach of those two aforementioned offerings. The WCA for Ansible Lightspeed flavor of IBM Granite code models specializes (Majors) only in Ansible Playbooks and YAML Similarly, the IBM Granite code model used by WCA for Z specializes in transforming COBOL mainframe code into modernized Java code Ansible Playbooks, COBOL, and Java are all supported (Minor) languages for the generalized IBM Granite code models\u2014 and therefore are supported by IBM watsonx Code Assistant \u2014but if a client wishes to specialize in those particular languages and frameworks, they would be well advised to utilize the bespoke WCA for Ansible Lightspeed and WCA for Z offerings to do so. iv. Solution architecture of IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed ( WCA ) meets developers where they are: with a rich plugin via VS Code extensions, where developers input their prompts directly in the code editor. Prompts are sent to the Ansible Lightspeed service, and the service sends a suggestion back (a completion ) that\u2019s powered by the IBM watsonx Code Assistant Granite code models. It is important to note that all data in transit is encrypted and ephemeral so users can be confident and have trust in the security of the service during this exchange. In terms of data security, client Ansible playbooks and customized models that they may potentially have are stored in client-owned Cloud Object Storage (COS) and are not shared with IBM, Red Hat, or any other clients. In order to utilize the product, a client must have an existing license for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (the \u201dred tile\u201d component in the center of the diagram), as well as a license for IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed (the \u201cblue tile\u201d on the right of the diagram). Generative AI has recently demonstrated proficiency in creating syntactically correct and contextually relevant application code in a variety of programming languages. For example, if trained on a large dataset of Ansible Playbooks, generative AI models can be fine-tuned to understand the nuances of Playbook syntax and structure. An enterprise organization with dozens or hundreds of Playbooks within their IT estate today would have a rich corpus of training data on-hand that could be used to fine-tune AI models that are tailored to the automation needs and programming style or standards of that particular company. WHAT ARE PLAYBOOKS? Ansible Playbooks instruct Ansible\u2019s automation engine on how to execute tasks in a step-by-step manner. Playbooks defines roles, tasks, handlers, and other configurations; in turn, these attributes allow developers and users to codify complex orchestration scenarios. Conceptually, think of a Playbook as a recipe book for system administration: each recipe (or Playbook) spells out the steps required to achieve a particular system state or to complete a given operation. One of the standout features of Ansible Playbooks is that they are idempotent : executing Playbooks multiple times on the same system won't create additional \"side effects\" (unintended operations or creation of unwanted artifacts) after the first successful run. This ensures consistency and reliability across deployments of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform ( AAP ). As you will see throughout the hands-on training material, generative AI models provide a natural language prompt to users which in turn is understood and translated by the AI models into the necessary Ansible Task code. For example, a user might describe a desired system state in plain language (\"I want a Playbook to install and start the Apache web server\") and the model will generate the appropriate Ansible Tasks for a Playbook. All of this is achieved without physically writing code or requiring much programming expertise. Not only does this speed up the automation process by cutting the time needed to author Playbooks, but it also democratizes access to automation in general. Even those within a company with limited Ansible or programming expertise will be able to produce effective Playbooks. There are plenty of caveats of course, and thorough validation and testing of AI-generated code will be needed before being put into production. However, the productivity gains and broadening of skillsets within an organization can be tremendous. And as a whole, generative AI brings the original goals of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (the democratization of automation for everything) that much closer to a reality. v. Lab objectives The material covered for this hands-on training is intended to prepare IBM sellers and business partners with the skills necessary to create Ansible automation tasks using the generative AI capabilities of WCA. The curriculum will leverage WCA's generative AI code recommendations for automating cloud-based and infrastructure-based automation tasks. In-depth explanations accompanying Ansible Playbook templates will also explain: How WCA uses natural language prompts , as well as Ansible Playbook contents, to generate contextually-aware Task code recommendations Post-processing capabilities that refine the generative AI suggestions into syntactically correct code (adherent to best practices) How WCA provides content source matching attribution and \"explainability\" for all AI-generated content Leveraging WCA's model tuning capabilities to tailor content and code recommendations to an organization's standards, best practices, and programming styles OPTIONAL CONTENT To conclude the Level 3 Technical Sales education on WCA, you will be provided with a complete set of instructions for deploying a LIVE Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment with Ansible automation, consisting of a WordPress web application running atop an Amazon EC2 VPC . This section is entirely OPTIONAL and not required for Level 3 credit; however, it is highly recommended by the authors that you attempt the section, given the tremendous demonstration value it provides for clients. The generation of Ansible Tasks and code required to automate these deployments will be created using the generative AI capabilities of the WCA extension for VS Code. The deployment of these environments will be conducted entirely using Red Hat Ansible automation, executed on your local machine, and deployed to AWS cloud. vi.

Running the fully-deployed WordPress and EC2 environments for 24 hours cost USD $2.03 in billing when testing for publication. Additional AWS pricing details and plans are available online. To conclude the Level 3 Technical Sales education on IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed ( WCA ), you will be provided with a complete set of instructions for deploying a live Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment with Ansible automation, consisting of a WordPress web application running atop an Amazon EC2 VPC . The deployment of the environments will be conducted entirely using Red Hat Ansible automation, executed on your local machine, and deployed to AWS cloud. The generation of the Ansible Tasks and code required to automate these deployments will be created using the generative AI capabilities of the WCA extension for VS Code. Ansible Playbooks to support this demo were prepared ahead of time in a public GitHub repository and are available for your use at the links below. TEMPLATE ( .yml ) : https://github.com/bienko/WCA-Lightspeed-L3/blob/main/TEMPLATE.yml The TEMPLATE.yml Playbook contains the skeleton of the application you will ultimately build. Playbook structure, key variables, Task descriptions, and comments are provided. Use the generative AI capabilities of WCA to fill out the details of the various Ansible Tasks, then compare the results with the SOLUTION.yml file below. SOLUTION ( .yml ) : https://github.com/bienko/WCA-Lightspeed-L3/blob/main/SOLUTION.yml The SOLUTION.yml Playbook contains the complete set of Ansible Playbook instructions needed to fully deploy a live EC2 VPC instance on AWS and host a WordPress application within that environment. You will need to replace certain variables (indicated by comments in the code) with details specific to your personal AWS account and environment. Afterwards, you can\u2014 and are encouraged to \u2014execute the Playbook with Ansible and deploy a live , at-cost instance to your personal AWS account. Once the two YAML files have been downloaded to your local machine, open them with VS Code and follow along with the instructions below. DOWNLOAD .yml FILES TO DESKTOP You can easily downlod the TEMPLATE and SOLUTION .yml files to your local machine. Navigate to the GitHub links provided (above) and click the Download raw file button. HOW TO CREATE NEW YAML PLAYBOOKS Note: You need to copy and paste the contents of the Playbook into a New File... within the same Lightspeed project directory that was used for the previous lab modules in order for the VS Code extension to engage. To create a new YAML Playbook within a VS Code environment: a. Copy the contents of the Playbook to clipboard using the button in the top-right corner of the lab guide code block. b. Return to your VS Code environment. In the top-left corner of the interface, with your Ansible Lightspeed folder selected, click the New File... button. c. Name the file to a description of your choosing, ending with .yml as the filetype. Set it to CustomPlaybook.yml , for example. Save it to one of the directories in the ansible-wca-demo-kit folder. d. Paste the clipboard contents into the YAML file and follow along with the suggestions below. COPY AND PASTE CODE WITHIN THE VM Information \"copied\" to your local machine's clipboard cannot be \"pasted\" directly into the virtual machine (VM) environment or VS Code. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED IS MISSING OR CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible Use WCA to generate code for the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook, then compare against the SOLUTION.yml Playbook to evaluate the results In the steps ahead, you will use WCA's AI-generated code suggestions to populate the contents of Tasks within the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook. There are 14 Tasks in total and we will examine them each in sequence. For each Task, a tabbed code snippet is provided within this lab documentation to make it easy for you to toggle between the TEMPLATE (the Task prior to AI-generated code suggestions) and the proper SOLUTION (the Task as it should be written for a successful deployment to AWS). Compare the AI-generated code suggestions you receive in VS Code with the expected SOLUTION code. You will find that there are occassional discrepancies and variables that need to be adjusted. Generative AI can save users tremendous amounts of time and effort by automating the creation of powerful blocks of code\u2014 as you will observe in generating these tasks \u2014but it still requires a degree of human supervision and double-checking. However, the time saved with hands on keyboard is enormous and the potential for the future is boundless. Open the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook in VS Code and ensure that the Ansible Lightspeed extension is active. Scroll down MODULE 1 ( Line 4 ) and take note of the comments, as well as the <PLACEHOLDER> values. If you wish to fully deploy this environment to AWS, you will need to register for an AWS account, create an IAM (Identity Access Management) user, and associate an SSH key with the necessary permissions to access the account. These values will then be substituted in your code for the aws_access_key and aws_secret_key variables. Instructions on how to sign up for AWS and create those keys will be included at the end of this module, and you will be reminded at that time to update these variables. However, for now, let's focus on generating the Ansible Tasks. Continue scrolling down until you reach TASK 1 ( Line 18 ) for the creation of a virtual private cloud (VPC) named 'wordpress'. Generate the Task code within VS Code and compare your results with the SOLUTION tab.

It is responsible for ensuring that WordPress is deployed on the newly-provisioned AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and that the WordPress web page is accessible to the user. As you did previously in Step 2 , you will need to replace the <PLACEHOLDER> values and region details on Lines 96-98 if you want to fully deploy this application into a live AWS environment. Locate TASK 13 ( Line 101 ) which is responsible for gathering facts about AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and the deployed WordPress application that is running atop of it.

Congratulations on making it this far! At this stage, your Playbook is ready for execution. However, there are still some preparation that you need to do before this Playbook can be used to automate deployment of the WordPress application into a live Amazon EC2 environment. In order to execute the Ansible Playbook on your local machine, you will need to install Ansible locally. Red Hat provides extensive online documentation for how to go about installing Ansible The authors of your lab guide recommend doing so by executing the following instructions in a Terminal window (macOS), or equivalent steps using PowerShell (Windows) Follow the prompts until you receive confirmation that Ansible is installed brew install ansible HOMEBREW IS MISSING \u2014 CLICK TO EXPAND If you do not have the Homebrew package manager (\"brew\") installed in a macOS environment, execute the following instruction inside a Terminal console: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Wait for the installation to conclude and then retry the instructions from Step 18. If you have not registered for an AWS account previously, you need to do so now. You will need to supply a personal credit card for billing expenses If you have an existing Amazon account, your AWS account can be linked to that profile if you so choose AWS Registration : https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/ With a registered AWS account, you next need to navigate from the AWS dashboard into the Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool. You can search for this using the Search bar at the top of the screen and entering IAM . Once inside the IAM tool, look along the left-side of the interface and drill down into Users . Click the Create User orange button located in the top-right corner of the interface. Within the Create User panel, specify your user details and permissions. Set Username to a name of your choosing. Click Next to advance the configuration tool. Under Set Permissions > Permission Options , select the Add user to group tile. Click the Set permissions boundary - optional tile to expand permission options. Toggle the checkmark next to the Use a permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions option. Under Permissions Policies , search the table for the AdministratorAccess policy and enable that policy. You may receive warnings against doing so \u2014 ignore those for now. Continue following the prompts until the User has been created. Once the User has been created, your web browser will reopen the User panel of the IAM tool. Here you can see various details about the User, including their Security Credentials and any keys associated with the User. This section will be empty given that you have only just now created the User. Drill down into the Access Keys category and click the Create Access Key button located below the (empty) table. A secret access key will be created and the web browser will reload to show you details about that key. Record this information to a notepad. Details about the secret access key can only be viewed or downloaded at the time the key is created (now). It cannot be recovered afterwards. However, if you lose your key details, all is not lost \u2014 you can always create a new secret access key at a later time. Record the Access Key , which will be used to replace the <PLACEHOLDER> value assigned to aws_access_key in Step 2 and Step 15 of this lab guide. Record the Secret Access Key , which will replace the <PLACEHOLDER> value assigned to aws_secret_key in Step 2 and Step 15 of this lab guide. Take note at this time as well about the Region in which your AWS account is located. You can easily look up this information by examining the URL in your web browser address bar, as shown below ( us-east-1 ). Record the region's name, as it will replace the region value assigned to the Playbook. PLAYBOOK MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED Replace the <PLACEHOLDER> values for variables aws_access_key and aws_secret_key with the Access Key and Secret Access Key , respectively. Lines 13, 14, 96, and 97 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Lines 13, 14, 179, and 180 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook Replace the value for variable region with the region assigned to your unique AWS account. Lines 15 and 98 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Lines 15 and 181 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook Next, you'll need to create an SSH Key Pair with authorization to interact with (and ultimately deploy) Amazon EC2 instances. Return to the search bar at the top of the AWS interface and enter EC2 . Drill down into the Amazon EC2 service page from the results. From the left-hand navigation bar, drill down into the Network & Security > Key Pairs tab. Click the orange Create key pair button in the top-right of the page. A configuration tool will ask for additional information about the Key Pair: Name can be set to a value of your choosing Key pair type set to RSA Private key file format set to .pem When satisfied, click the orange Create key pair button The web browser will redirect to a page where you can view details about the newly-created Key Pair for EC2. Download the .pem file to your local device, preferably to the same directory that your TEMPLATE.yml and SOLUTION.yml Playbooks are located within. PLAYBOOK MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED The value of ansible_ssh_private_key_file must be updated within your Playbooks to account for the full path to the .pem file on your local machine. If you save the Key Pair file to the same directory that your Ansible Playbooks are located within, you do not need to qualify the value with anything more than the name of the file ( bienko-key.pem ). If it is saved in a different directory, you will need to spell out the full path + file name. Update the value of ansible_ssh_private_key_file in the following locations: Line 58 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Line 113 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook It is necessary to adjust the permissions assigned to the Key Pair file (on your local machine) before attempting to connect via Ansible to AWS. Open a Terminal console on your local machine and navigate ( cd ) to the directory in which the Key Pair file is saved. Execute the following to adjust the permissions assigned to the .pem file: chmod 400 filename.pem Executing the Ansible Playbook At last, you are ready to execute the Playbook and use Ansible automation to deploy both an Amazon EC2 instance and a WordPress web application. With the Terminal console, navigate to the directory ( cd ) where both the Ansible Playbook and your KeyPair.pem file are located. You may use either the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook that you customized or the SOLUTION.yml Playbook for executing the Ansible automation tasks. Regardless of the Playbook being used, you must modify the Playbook with the necessary AWS security and account credentials information. When ready, execute the following instruction with the Terminal console: ansible-playbook TEMPLATE.yml Monitor the console's output as the Ansible Playbook iterates across each of the Tasks customized earlier. A fantastic feature of Ansible's automation is that if any of the Tasks should fail, the steps involved in that Task can be re-tried in subsequent runs; likewise, Tasks which executed successfully won't be repeated, but are validated and skipped instead. If you encounter errors during the litany of automation tasks, return to the Playbook and attempt to debug the issue. Re-issue the instruction in Step 34 to console to attempt the Ansible Playbook execution again. Continue iterating in this manner until all 14 Tasks have been successfully executed. After successfully deploying the Amazon EC2 environment and instantiating a WordPress application, the console will return a URL to the Terminal's output as part of TASK 14 's [debug] instruction. Copy the URL to clipboard and then paste it into your web browser to access the WordPress application. If your web browser loads the quick-start page for WordPress, you have successfully deployed the application and its supporting EC2 environment \u2014 entirely using generative AI and Ansible automation. Well done! Cleaning up and conclusion COSTS & BILLING It is essential that you terminate and deprovision the EC2 instance at the conclusion of the hands on lab. Otherwise, your personal AWS account will continue to be billed for as long as the resources are provisioned. Once you are ready to retire your environment, you will need to return to the AWS Dashboard to terminate the EC2 instance and hosted WordPress application. You can monitor your Amazon EC2 instance from the EC2 dashboard. At the top of the page, locate the Resources table and drill down into the Instances (running) tab. Details about your EC2 environment are summarized within the Instances table. Click the name of your EC2's Instance ID to expose additional details and management options. In the top-right corner of the interface, click the Instance state button and select Terminate instance from the drop-down menu. Confirm the deprovisioning request by clicking the orange Terminate button. All storage associated with the EC2 instance will automatically be deleted. Terminating an instance cannot be undone once underway. It is recommended that you delete all of the Security Groups (3 total) and Key Pairs (1 total) associated with the EC2 instance. To do so, return to the EC2 Dashboard and follow a similar procedure to Steps 38-41 . Search for IAM in the AWS taskbar to return to the Identity Access Management panel. If you wish to further secure your AWS account, delete all unwanted users or consider reducing the user's privilege from AdministratorAccess to a more restrictive class. That concludes the hands-on components to this Level 3 course, but your learning and experimentation doesn't need to end here. Continue to experiment with generating Tasks for Ansible Playbooks. If you have worked extensively with Ansible previously, try recreating Tasks you've written previously from old Playbooks using generative AI \u2014 just be careful not to use confidential or sensitive information as part of those tests. See if you can spot the differences or improvements made from the AI-generated code recommendations. Feel free to reach out to the authors of this coursework if you have suggestions for Tasks or code generation techniques that you'd like to see included in future iterations of this hands-on training.","title":"(OPTIONAL) Deploying a Live AWS EC2 Instance and WordPress Application"},{"location":"advanced/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"advanced/#use-wca-to-generate-code-for-the-templateyml-playbook-then-compare-against-the-solutionyml-playbook-to-evaluate-the-results","text":"","title":"Use WCA to generate code for the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook, then compare against the SOLUTION.yml Playbook to evaluate the results"},{"location":"advanced/#_2","text":"In the steps ahead, you will use WCA's AI-generated code suggestions to populate the contents of Tasks within the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook. There are 14 Tasks in total and we will examine them each in sequence. For each Task, a tabbed code snippet is provided within this lab documentation to make it easy for you to toggle between the TEMPLATE (the Task prior to AI-generated code suggestions) and the proper SOLUTION (the Task as it should be written for a successful deployment to AWS). Compare the AI-generated code suggestions you receive in VS Code with the expected SOLUTION code. You will find that there are occassional discrepancies and variables that need to be adjusted. Generative AI can save users tremendous amounts of time and effort by automating the creation of powerful blocks of code\u2014 as you will observe in generating these tasks \u2014but it still requires a degree of human supervision and double-checking. However, the time saved with hands on keyboard is enormous and the potential for the future is boundless. Open the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook in VS Code and ensure that the Ansible Lightspeed extension is active. Scroll down MODULE 1 ( Line 4 ) and take note of the comments, as well as the <PLACEHOLDER> values. If you wish to fully deploy this environment to AWS, you will need to register for an AWS account, create an IAM (Identity Access Management) user, and associate an SSH key with the necessary permissions to access the account. These values will then be substituted in your code for the aws_access_key and aws_secret_key variables. Instructions on how to sign up for AWS and create those keys will be included at the end of this module, and you will be reminded at that time to update these variables. However, for now, let's focus on generating the Ansible Tasks. Continue scrolling down until you reach TASK 1 ( Line 18 ) for the creation of a virtual private cloud (VPC) named 'wordpress'.

TEMPLATE SOLUTION # TASK 7 # This section has been hard-coded ahead of time. # DO NOT regenerate using AI-suggested code. # Replace `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` value with path on local machine to SSH key \u2014 INCLUDE .pem as part of filename # Use 'chmod 400' to change file permissions of .pem file before executing Playbook - name : Add host to inventory using tunnel using wordpress_instance public ip and ansible user ec2-user ansible.builtin.add_host : name : wordpress ansible_host : \"{ { wordpress_server.instances[0].public_ip_address } }\" ansible_user : ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file : \"bienko-key.pem\" # TASK 7 # This section has been hard-coded ahead of time. # DO NOT regenerate using AI-suggested code. # Replace `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` value with path on local machine to SSH key \u2014 INCLUDE .pem as part of filename # Use 'chmod 400' to change file permissions of .pem file before executing Playbook - name : Add host to inventory using tunnel using wordpress_instance public ip and ansible user ec2-user ansible.builtin.add_host : name : wordpress ansible_host : \"{ { wordpress_server.instances[0].public_ip_address } }\" ansible_user : ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file : \"bienko-key.pem\" PLAYBOOK MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED Although TASK 7 does not require WCA to generate any code suggestions, it does require the user to modify the value of the ansible_ssh_private_key_file attribute. Set this attribute to the directory path where the private SSH key ( .pem file) is located on your local machine. Be sure to include the .pem filetype as part of the value and also ensure you have changed the permissions on the file (using Terminal and executing the chmod 400 bienko-key.pem instruction) before attempting to run the Playbook. Scrolling further down the Playbook you will find MODULE B ( Line 60 ), made up Ansible Tasks concerned with installing and configuring WordPress on the newly-provisioned AWS EC2 (VPC) instance. Locate TASK 8 ( Line 67 ) which waits for a connection to be established to the EC2 instance before advancing the sequence of automation tasks.

It is responsible for ensuring that WordPress is deployed on the newly-provisioned AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and that the WordPress web page is accessible to the user. As you did previously in Step 2 , you will need to replace the <PLACEHOLDER> values and region details on Lines 96-98 if you want to fully deploy this application into a live AWS environment. Locate TASK 13 ( Line 101 ) which is responsible for gathering facts about AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and the deployed WordPress application that is running atop of it. TEMPLATE SOLUTION # TASK 13 # Gather facts about AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and deployed WordPress application. - name : Gather ec2 instance info for tag name wordpress # TASK 13 # Gather facts about AWS EC2 (VPC) instance and deployed WordPress application. - name : Gather ec2 instance info for tag name wordpress amazon.aws.ec2_instance_info : filters : tag:Name : wordpress instance-state-name : running register : ec2_facts Finally, you have arrived at the final step in the Playbook configuration: TASK 14 ( Line 105 ), which is responsible for hosting the WordPress web app and making it accessible to users.

At this stage, your Playbook is ready for execution. However, there are still some preparation that you need to do before this Playbook can be used to automate deployment of the WordPress application into a live Amazon EC2 environment. In order to execute the Ansible Playbook on your local machine, you will need to install Ansible locally. Red Hat provides extensive online documentation for how to go about installing Ansible The authors of your lab guide recommend doing so by executing the following instructions in a Terminal window (macOS), or equivalent steps using PowerShell (Windows) Follow the prompts until you receive confirmation that Ansible is installed brew install ansible HOMEBREW IS MISSING \u2014 CLICK TO EXPAND If you do not have the Homebrew package manager (\"brew\") installed in a macOS environment, execute the following instruction inside a Terminal console: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Wait for the installation to conclude and then retry the instructions from Step 18. If you have not registered for an AWS account previously, you need to do so now. You will need to supply a personal credit card for billing expenses If you have an existing Amazon account, your AWS account can be linked to that profile if you so choose AWS Registration : https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/ With a registered AWS account, you next need to navigate from the AWS dashboard into the Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool. You can search for this using the Search bar at the top of the screen and entering IAM . Once inside the IAM tool, look along the left-side of the interface and drill down into Users . Click the Create User orange button located in the top-right corner of the interface. Within the Create User panel, specify your user details and permissions. Set Username to a name of your choosing. Click Next to advance the configuration tool. Under Set Permissions > Permission Options , select the Add user to group tile. Click the Set permissions boundary - optional tile to expand permission options. Toggle the checkmark next to the Use a permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions option. Under Permissions Policies , search the table for the AdministratorAccess policy and enable that policy. You may receive warnings against doing so \u2014 ignore those for now. Continue following the prompts until the User has been created. Once the User has been created, your web browser will reopen the User panel of the IAM tool. Here you can see various details about the User, including their Security Credentials and any keys associated with the User. This section will be empty given that you have only just now created the User. Drill down into the Access Keys category and click the Create Access Key button located below the (empty) table. A secret access key will be created and the web browser will reload to show you details about that key. Record this information to a notepad. Details about the secret access key can only be viewed or downloaded at the time the key is created (now). It cannot be recovered afterwards. However, if you lose your key details, all is not lost \u2014 you can always create a new secret access key at a later time. Record the Access Key , which will be used to replace the <PLACEHOLDER> value assigned to aws_access_key in Step 2 and Step 15 of this lab guide. Record the Secret Access Key , which will replace the <PLACEHOLDER> value assigned to aws_secret_key in Step 2 and Step 15 of this lab guide. Take note at this time as well about the Region in which your AWS account is located. You can easily look up this information by examining the URL in your web browser address bar, as shown below ( us-east-1 ). Record the region's name, as it will replace the region value assigned to the Playbook. PLAYBOOK MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED Replace the <PLACEHOLDER> values for variables aws_access_key and aws_secret_key with the Access Key and Secret Access Key , respectively. Lines 13, 14, 96, and 97 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Lines 13, 14, 179, and 180 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook Replace the value for variable region with the region assigned to your unique AWS account. Lines 15 and 98 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Lines 15 and 181 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook Next, you'll need to create an SSH Key Pair with authorization to interact with (and ultimately deploy) Amazon EC2 instances. Return to the search bar at the top of the AWS interface and enter EC2 . Drill down into the Amazon EC2 service page from the results. From the left-hand navigation bar, drill down into the Network & Security > Key Pairs tab. Click the orange Create key pair button in the top-right of the page. A configuration tool will ask for additional information about the Key Pair: Name can be set to a value of your choosing Key pair type set to RSA Private key file format set to .pem When satisfied, click the orange Create key pair button The web browser will redirect to a page where you can view details about the newly-created Key Pair for EC2. Download the .pem file to your local device, preferably to the same directory that your TEMPLATE.yml and SOLUTION.yml Playbooks are located within. PLAYBOOK MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED The value of ansible_ssh_private_key_file must be updated within your Playbooks to account for the full path to the .pem file on your local machine. If you save the Key Pair file to the same directory that your Ansible Playbooks are located within, you do not need to qualify the value with anything more than the name of the file ( bienko-key.pem ). If it is saved in a different directory, you will need to spell out the full path + file name. Update the value of ansible_ssh_private_key_file in the following locations: Line 58 of the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook Line 113 of the SOLUTION.yml Playbook It is necessary to adjust the permissions assigned to the Key Pair file (on your local machine) before attempting to connect via Ansible to AWS. Open a Terminal console on your local machine and navigate ( cd ) to the directory in which the Key Pair file is saved. Execute the following to adjust the permissions assigned to the .pem file: chmod 400 filename.pem","title":""},{"location":"advanced/#executing-the-ansible-playbook","text":"","title":"Executing the Ansible Playbook"},{"location":"advanced/#_4","text":"At last, you are ready to execute the Playbook and use Ansible automation to deploy both an Amazon EC2 instance and a WordPress web application. With the Terminal console, navigate to the directory ( cd ) where both the Ansible Playbook and your KeyPair.pem file are located. You may use either the TEMPLATE.yml Playbook that you customized or the SOLUTION.yml Playbook for executing the Ansible automation tasks. Regardless of the Playbook being used, you must modify the Playbook with the necessary AWS security and account credentials information. When ready, execute the following instruction with the Terminal console: ansible-playbook TEMPLATE.yml Monitor the console's output as the Ansible Playbook iterates across each of the Tasks customized earlier. A fantastic feature of Ansible's automation is that if any of the Tasks should fail, the steps involved in that Task can be re-tried in subsequent runs; likewise, Tasks which executed successfully won't be repeated, but are validated and skipped instead. If you encounter errors during the litany of automation tasks, return to the Playbook and attempt to debug the issue. Re-issue the instruction in Step 34 to console to attempt the Ansible Playbook execution again. Continue iterating in this manner until all 14 Tasks have been successfully executed. After successfully deploying the Amazon EC2 environment and instantiating a WordPress application, the console will return a URL to the Terminal's output as part of TASK 14 's [debug] instruction. Copy the URL to clipboard and then paste it into your web browser to access the WordPress application.

Otherwise, your personal AWS account will continue to be billed for as long as the resources are provisioned. Once you are ready to retire your environment, you will need to return to the AWS Dashboard to terminate the EC2 instance and hosted WordPress application. You can monitor your Amazon EC2 instance from the EC2 dashboard. At the top of the page, locate the Resources table and drill down into the Instances (running) tab. Details about your EC2 environment are summarized within the Instances table. Click the name of your EC2's Instance ID to expose additional details and management options. In the top-right corner of the interface, click the Instance state button and select Terminate instance from the drop-down menu. Confirm the deprovisioning request by clicking the orange Terminate button. All storage associated with the EC2 instance will automatically be deleted. Terminating an instance cannot be undone once underway. It is recommended that you delete all of the Security Groups (3 total) and Key Pairs (1 total) associated with the EC2 instance. To do so, return to the EC2 Dashboard and follow a similar procedure to Steps 38-41 . Search for IAM in the AWS taskbar to return to the Identity Access Management panel. If you wish to further secure your AWS account, delete all unwanted users or consider reducing the user's privilege from AdministratorAccess to a more restrictive class. That concludes the hands-on components to this Level 3 course, but your learning and experimentation doesn't need to end here. Continue to experiment with generating Tasks for Ansible Playbooks. If you have worked extensively with Ansible previously, try recreating Tasks you've written previously from old Playbooks using generative AI \u2014 just be careful not to use confidential or sensitive information as part of those tests. See if you can spot the differences or improvements made from the AI-generated code recommendations.

As you settle in to the environment and begin your training, you may encounter unexpected warnings or errors. Many of these can be safely ignored or can be easily rectified. This section will serve as a running list of frequently asked questions and troubleshooting techniques. Click on any of the following topics for additional details. FAILED TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / \"YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IBM WATSONX...\" This warning will occur when the Ansible plugin for VS Code needs to be re-authenticated with WCA. It can occur after an extended period of inactivity or a system restart. For example, if your lab environment is running inside a VM, pausing or restarting the VM may produce this error. To re-authenticate: Sign out from the VS Code application by clicking the User icon [A] in the bottom-left corner of the interface, hover over your username, and then click Sign Out [B] If you are running this environment inside a virtual machine (VM) , closing and restarting the VM will not resolve the issue \u2014 you must sign out from the VS Code application, not the VM Once logged out, follow from Step 7 of the Setup & Troubleshooting to re-authenticate with WCA CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible \"ANSIBLE-LINT IS NOT AVAILABLE.\" ansible-lint checks Playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved and can fix some of the most common ones for you. It will constantly check your Ansible syntax as you type and provide recommendations for how to improve it. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises If you wish to install ansible-lint on your local machine, execute the following instruction within a Terminal console: python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible-lint RED ANSIBLE ICON ALONG BOTTOM-RIGHT INTERFACE The Ansible extension for VS Code will check your local machine to determine if Red Hat Ansible has been installed locally. If you have not set up Ansible (the standalone version) on your local machine previously, this tile will display as red. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises. CANNOT SET PROPERTIES OF UNDEFINED (SETTING 'currentModelValue') Make sure that the Model ID Override field is set to empty in your Ansible for VS Code extension settings. To verify this: Click the Extensions tab [A] along the left-hand interface Click the Manage icon [B] on the right side of the Ansible extension tile, then drill down into Extension Settings [C] Add the text Model to the search filter [D] at the top of the Extension Settings panel Clear the input field [E] of any model IDs and leave it blank Close the Extension Settings panel by clicking X and return to the Ansible Playbook SPAWN C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe ENOENT This warning is not related to Ansible or WCA. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises. PYTHON DRIVERS ARE MISSING The WCA extension for VS Code requires that Python drivers are included within the workspace. These are usually configured within VS Code by default, but can be easily set if necessary. Look for a Python tile adjacent to the Ansible tile along the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface. If it is not set, click the tile and select the Python 3.11.5 64-bit drivers. Click the gold-colored Select python environment button at the bottom-right of the interface From the console at the top of the VS Code environment, select the recommended Python 3.11.5 64-bit option and hit Enter to confirm GIT NOT INSTALLED If your machine has not used Git previously, you may be prompted by VS Code to install it before attempting a clone request. This is more commonplace on Windows operating systems, but some MacOS users may need to install Git as well. The following instructions will guide you through the process: With the VS Code application open, click the Source Control [A] tab from the left-hand interface and then click Download Git [B] . A web browser will open to the git-scm.com Downloads page. Download [C] the version recommended for your machine's particular operating system. The recommended version will be displayed first at the top of the list. Execute the installer on your machine and follow along with the prompts to finish installing Git. Accept the license agreement and accept the default values on each page. Return to VS Code and once again click the Source Control [D] tab, then click the blue Initialize Repository [E] button. From the top of the Source Control tab, click the three dots ... [F] icon to expand a drop-down menu of options. Click on the Clone [G] option. Follow the instructions for the remainder of this section to clone the ansible-wca-demo-kit repository to your local machine [H] . COPY AND PASTE INSTRUCTIONS INTO A VIRTUAL MACHINE If you are running the lab environment inside a virtual machine (VM), it might not be possible to \"paste\" lab instructions from your local machine's clipboard directly into the VM. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor.

The iterative process that you will go through in this module can be viewed in three different ways: On the one hand, it shows the sensitivity of generative AI models to even the most nuanced change in natural language prompts \u2014 for good or bad. Generative AI can produce tremendous work and that output is further guided along by best practices built-in from Red Hat and IBM. But in the end, the AI can only infer user intent from the natural language descriptions supplied to it. The more clearly a user defines their Task descriptions and intent, the more likely that WCA will correctly generate code which mirrors that intent; conversely, the less precise those descriptions are, the more likely WCA will misinterpret and miss the mark. Precision is key for the disambiguation of natural language prompts. Human feedback and humans-in-the-loop are essential to these formative stages of generative AI. As offerings like WCA mature, the natural language processing capabilities of the service will continue to be refined and improved. Additional packages, functions, and training data from Ansible Galaxy (as well as other sources) are continuously being added to the product's Foundation Models, which will in turn continually improve the AI-generated code recommendations made to users. By using the Model Tuning capabilities built into IBM watsonx Code Assistant , organizations and users are able to customize the recommendations produced by generative AI, tuning a domain-specific LLM with the organization's own Ansible Playbooks. The content and code recommendations that WCA suggests can be tailored to an organization's standards, best practices, and programming styles. These capabilities will be explored later in this module. The take-away here is that your results may vary : they may differ from the SOLUTION code presented in the steps below. Keep this in mind as you work through the examples in this section and understand that it is not a bug, but rather a consequence of working with generative AI in general. The precision with which a Playbook author describes Ansible Tasks in natural language will determine the accuracy and effectiveness of WCA's generated code recommendations. A template CUSTOM PLAYBOOK #1 YAML file has been prepared for you below. Copy and paste the code from the TEMPLATE tab into a New File... within VS Code Name and save the file as you see fit: for example, customplaybook1.yml HOW TO CREATE NEW YAML PLAYBOOKS Note: You need to copy and paste the contents of the Playbook into a New File... within the same Lightspeed project directory that was used for the previous lab modules in order for the VS Code extension to engage. To create a new YAML Playbook within a VS Code environment: a. Copy the contents of the Playbook to clipboard using the button in the top-right corner of the lab guide code block. b. Return to your VS Code environment. In the top-left corner of the interface, with your Ansible Lightspeed folder selected, click the New File... button. c. Name the file to a description of your choosing, ending with .yml as the filetype. Set it to CustomPlaybook.yml , for example. Save it to one of the directories in the ansible-wca-demo-kit folder. d. Paste the clipboard contents into the YAML file and follow along with the suggestions below. COPY AND PASTE CODE WITHIN THE VM Information \"copied\" to your local machine's clipboard cannot be \"pasted\" directly into the virtual machine (VM) environment or VS Code. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED IS MISSING OR CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible CUSTOM PLAYBOOK 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 # CUSTOM PLAYBOOK #1 \u2014 Invoke 2 modules to automatically update 2 types of servers. --- # TASK 1 - name : Update web servers hosts : webservers become : true tasks : - name : Ensure apache is at the latest version - name : Write the apache config file # TASK 2 - name : Update db servers hosts : databases become : true tasks : - name : Ensure postgresql is at the latest version - name : Ensure that postgresql is started The template CUSTOM PLAYBOOK #1 contains two sets of tasks: TASK 1 ( Lines 5-12 ) checks if the web server software is up to date and runs an update if necessary TASK 2 ( Lines 15-22 ) checks if the database server software is up to date and runs an update if necessary Examine the instruction on Line 12 , which prompts Ansible to create (\"write\") a configuration file for an Apache webserver: - name : Write the apache config file Place your cursor at the end of Line 12 and press Enter to generate WCA-recommended code for the task. Accept the recommendation by pressing Tab . Two tabs are presented below: AI-GENERATED CODE shows the output from running WCA's generative AI capabilities on Line 12 of the unmodified CUSTOM PLAYBOOK #1 YAML template. SOLUTION CODE shows the expected (correct) code for performing the task that was written by a human programmer. In theory, the AI-generated code should be as good\u2014 or even superior to \u2014the manually-written solution code. AI-GENERATED CODE SOLUTION CODE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - name : Write the apache config file ansible.builtin.template : src : templates/apache.conf.j2 dest : /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf owner : root group : root mode : '0644' 1 2 3 4 5 - name : Write the apache config file ansible.builtin.template : src : /srv/httpd.j2 dest : /etc/httpd.config mode : \"0644\" As you can see, the AI-GENERATED CODE recommendations satisfy some of the requests, but also miss the mark in a few areas. When compared to the SOLUTION CODE tab: Both tabs appropriately utilize the ansible.builtin.template Module, which for this request is absolutely correct. Interesting fact: earlier (circa 2023) versions of WCA produced code recommendations for the same task as this one, which did not align with the expected solution. Instead, the recommendation was for the ansible.builtin.copy: Module to invoke content: \"{{ _content_ }}\" , which is not correct. This speaks to the continuously improving capabilities of the WCA and IBM Granite models. AI-GENERATED CODE recommended including statements that explicitly set owner: root and group: root , which are both appropriate when permissions are set to mode: '0644' . While not strictly necessary, these additional statements arguably are an improvement over the SOLUTION CODE results. It's also worth noting that the request to write the apache config file did not explicitly request mode: '0644' in the natural language description, but WCA nevertheless recommended it (post-processing) as this is a best practice for deploying Apache webservers. The src and dest variables are not in agreement across the AI-GENERATED CODE and SOLUTION CODE tabs. This is an area for improvement. The natural language description wasn't precise about these details; therefore, this is an opportunity where more detailed and verbose instructions could better steer the recommendations WCA returns back with. In general, the more ambiguous the Task description, the greater the likelihood that WCA will misinterpret the author's intent and suggest unwanted Ansible automation jobs. To help disambiguate our intention, Playbook authors should use more precise natural language terms and descriptions. Delete the WCA-suggested lines of code from Step 4 from the Playbook. Rewrite the description on Line 12 to the following code block, then press Enter and Tab to accept the new WCA code recommendations Take note of the much more precise language used to describe the src and dest variables - name : Write the apache config file where src equals httpd.j2 and dest equals httpd.config The resulting WCA-recommended code should be similar to the AI-GENERATED CODE tab below. When compared to the SOLUTION CODE tab: The src: httpd.j2 recommendation in the AI-GENERATED CODE tab is an exact match to the natural language description set in Step 6 , and only slightly different (in terms of the directory path used) to the src: /srv/httpd.j2 variable in the SOLUTION CODE tab. The dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf recommendation in the AI-GENERATER CODE tab, unfortunately, still deviates from the httpd.config (not the same as httpd.conf ) destination that was requested in the natural language description. Close, but still far from exact and not matching our specifications. However, it's a vast improvement over the dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf destination that was recommended as a result of Step 4 's more ambiguous task description. Perplexingly, the mode: '0644' recommendation that was made previously in Step 4 has been left out of the suggested task code. We can speculate as to why\u2014 perhaps the more precise natural language description made in Step 6 prompted WCA to only generate code for exactly what was specified \u2014but the \"black box\" nature of generative AI means that we cannot know for certain. Perhaps with another, even more precise iteration the AI-GENERATED CODE will match the SOLUTION CODE ? AI-GENERATED CODE SOLUTION CODE 1 2 3 4 - name : Write the apache config file where src equals httpd.j2 and dest equals httpd.config ansible.builtin.template : src : httpd.j2 dest : /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 1 2 3 4 5 - name : Write the apache config file ansible.builtin.template : src : /srv/httpd.j2 dest : /etc/httpd.config mode : \"0644\" Iterate on the lessons learned in Step 7 and modify the task description to include more details on the permissions applied to the Apache webserver. Delete the WCA-suggested lines of code from Step 6 from the Playbook. Re-write the description on Line 12 to the following code block, then press Enter and Tab to accept the new WCA code recommendations. Take note of the much more precise language used to describe the mode variable. - name : Write the apache config file where src equals httpd.j2 and dest equals httpd.config and mode equals 0644 Once again, the resulting WCA-recommended code should be similar to the AI-GENERATED CODE tab below. When compared to the SOLUTION CODE tab: WCA correctly picked up on the mode: '0644' request made in the modified task description. There is now alignment between the two tabs. With only a few iterations and by disambiguating the natural language description of the Ansible Task to be performed, the code recommendations produced by WCA have been markedly improved. AI-GENERATED CODE SOLUTION CODE 1 2 3 4 5 - name : Write the apache config file where src equals httpd.j2 and dest equals httpd.config and mode equals 0644 ansible.builtin.template : src : httpd.j2 dest : /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf mode : '0644' 1 2 3 4 5 - name : Write the apache config file ansible.builtin.template : src : /srv/httpd.j2 dest : /etc/httpd.config mode : \"0644\" ii. Model customization Since every organization is different, WCA allows users to customize the AI model output to your organization's unique Ansible Playbooks. This allows for personalized code recommendations that are a better fit to your business' unique needs and more reflective of the programming standards set within your organization. In this scenario, your organization has its own set of Ansible Playbooks that leverage your preferred cloud provider, that uses specific Ansible Modules to manage OpenShift clusters. Open the create-openshift-cluster-ibm-cloud.yml Playbook located within the Model Customization subdirectory of the hands-on lab templates. The full directory address, as well as the Playbook code, are encapsulated in the following code block. ~/ansible-wca-demo-kit/Model Customization/create-openshift-cluster-ibm-cloud.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED IS MISSING OR CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible Before performing any model tuning tasks, try generating code recommendations for the OpenShift cluster creation task by placing your cursor at the end of Line 6 , pressing Enter , and then accepting the default recommendations by pressing Tab . The resulting code recommendations\u2014 displayed below \u2014represent the standard, unmodified output from WCA's IBM Granite base models. When using the standard IBM Granite model recommendations, it recommends making use of the ansible.builtin.command Ansible Module \u2014 which is a standard, best-practice way to perform these types of deployments. However, your particular organization (and the public cloud provider they use for deploying OpenShift clusters) might require the use of different Ansible Modules. The following steps will explore how to tailor WCA-generated code blocks to the unique needs of a business. STANDARD IBM GRANITE MODEL RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster ansible.builtin.command : oadm create-cluster --wait=false --name=openshift-cluster register : oadm_create_cluster changed_when : \"'created' in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" failed_when : \"'already exists' not in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" DATA PREPARATION & MODEL TRAINING Given the scope and time available for this hands-on training, participants will not be manually creating the training data or training models themselves. Instead, you will utilize a prepared customized model ( Model ID ) and experiment from Step 12 and onwards with how the tuned Model ID impacts WCA's code recommendations. The process of building Ansible training data and tuning customized models for generative AI is potentially a complex and time-consuming one. For example, the model tuning employed in the steps ahead for the creation of an OpenShift cluster according to an enterprise organization's specific standards requires approximately 4 hours to train and generate a customized AI model. In preparation for model tuning, an organization or user can transform their existing Playbooks into training data for WCA using the open-source Ansible Parser Tool . The tool analyzes Ansible Playbooks and generates a single JSONL ( ftdata.jsonl formatted) file that can be uploaded to WCA's model tuning studio for developing customized AI models. The process of calibrating and running the Ansible Parser Tool is time-consuming and potentially complex, depending on the scope of Playbooks that an organization wishes to analyze and prepare for model tuning. This falls outside the scope of the hands-on material for this training. For the purposes of demonstration, a preconfigured openshift-tune-micro.jsonl was used for the model tuning example. With the Ansible training data prepared, the IBM watsonx Code Assistant on IBM Cloud service was configured to execute a new model tuning experiment. WCA provides a graphical user experience [A] to streamline the model tuning and customization process Tuning experiment name [B] set to Tuning Experiment and confirmed with Create tuning experiment [C] The openshift-tune-micro.jsonl training data from Ansible Parser Tool is uploaded into WCA [D] A summary of metrics\u2014 including parameters for sampling and Ansible modules \u2014are displayed within the model tuning wizard before Start tuning [E] is selected to kick off the model tuning operating After the tuning operation has ended, a training loss graph reveals how accurate the model's predictions are over the training data set, across multiple tuning cycles As the number of tuning cycles increase, the training loss rating will tend to decrease Model tuning for these particular metrics and parameters takes approximately 4 hours to complete CLICK TO EXPAND \u2014 ACCOMPANYING SCREENSHOTS To override the IBM Granite base model recommendations, you must provide a pointer to a customized Model ID (prepared and hosted earlier on WCA) using the VS Code extension. Model ID : 479b0ed4-5592-46a9-bdce-52ad38948070<|sepofid|>7d783e5e-ea77-4dc9-a684-a2257f4eac43 Look for Ansible under the Installed services in the Extensions panel. Click the Manage (\"cogwheel\") icon located just to the right of the Ansible tile From the drop-down options, click Extension Settings [A] Within the search bar at the top of the panel, add the text Model to filter the results [B] Copy and paste the Model ID value (above) into the empty Ansible > Lightspeed: Model ID Override field [C] , then click the X in the top-left corner of the panel to save and exit Extension Settings With the tuned model, WCA will recommend code using modules, functions, and other details specific to your organization's private IT environment. Return to the tuning-example.yml Playbook from Step 10 and delete the code recommendations generated in Step 11 Regenerate the code recommendations for the task by placing your cursor at the end of Line 6 , hitting Enter , and then Tab Observe how the tuned Model ID has modified WCA's code recommendations by toggling between the TUNED MODEL and STANDARD MODEL tabs below TUNED MODEL STANDARD MODEL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster register : cluster_create_output when : cluster_output.rc != 0 ibm.cloudcollection.ibm_container_cluster : name : test_cluster datacenter : \"{{ datacenter }}\" machine_type : \"{{ machine_type }}\" hardware : \"{{ hardware }}\" kube_version : 4.14_openshift public_vlan_id : \"{{ public_vlan_id }}\" private_vlan_id : \"{{ private_vlan_id }}\" default_pool_size : \"{{ default_worker_pool_size }}\" entitlement : \"{{ entitlement }}\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster ansible.builtin.command : oadm create-cluster --wait=false --name=openshift-cluster register : oadm_create_cluster changed_when : \"'created' in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" failed_when : \"'already exists' not in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" Using the tuned Model ID , WCA has returned a recommendation to use the ibm.cloudcollection.ibm_container_cluster Module for the IBM Cloud, instead of the standard ansible.builtin.command Module from Step 11 . This more accurately conforms to the organization's Ansible automation standards and requirements. REMOVE THE CUSTOMIZED MODEL ID WHEN FINISHED Remember to clear the Ansible > Lightspeed: Model ID Override in the Extension Settings after you have completed Step 13 , otherwise all subsequent code generation requests made to WCA will be produced using the customized AI model. iii. Conclusion That concludes the hands-on components to this Level 3 course, but your learning and experimentation doesn't need to end here. The OPTIONAL module which follows teaches you how to craft a fully-functional Ansible Playbook for the automated deployment of an Amazon EC2 instance and WordPress application \u2014 deployable from your local machine into a live AWS environment. IBM technical sellers and business partners are NOT required to complete this section to receive Level 3 accreditation. However, it is highly recommended by the authors that you attempt the material, given the tremendous demonstration value it provides for clients. Otherwise, you are welcome to conclude the hands-on component at this point and follow the Level 3 accreditation steps (depending on your role).","title":"Task Description Tuning and Model Customization"},{"location":"customizing/#_1","text":"Christopher Bienko (Principal, IBM Global Sales Enablement) demonstrates key elements of the Task Description Tuning and Model Customization module.

This allows for personalized code recommendations that are a better fit to your business' unique needs and more reflective of the programming standards set within your organization. In this scenario, your organization has its own set of Ansible Playbooks that leverage your preferred cloud provider, that uses specific Ansible Modules to manage OpenShift clusters. Open the create-openshift-cluster-ibm-cloud.yml Playbook located within the Model Customization subdirectory of the hands-on lab templates. The full directory address, as well as the Playbook code, are encapsulated in the following code block. ~/ansible-wca-demo-kit/Model Customization/create-openshift-cluster-ibm-cloud.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED IS MISSING OR CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible Before performing any model tuning tasks, try generating code recommendations for the OpenShift cluster creation task by placing your cursor at the end of Line 6 , pressing Enter , and then accepting the default recommendations by pressing Tab . The resulting code recommendations\u2014 displayed below \u2014represent the standard, unmodified output from WCA's IBM Granite base models. When using the standard IBM Granite model recommendations, it recommends making use of the ansible.builtin.command Ansible Module \u2014 which is a standard, best-practice way to perform these types of deployments. However, your particular organization (and the public cloud provider they use for deploying OpenShift clusters) might require the use of different Ansible Modules. The following steps will explore how to tailor WCA-generated code blocks to the unique needs of a business.

Instead, you will utilize a prepared customized model ( Model ID ) and experiment from Step 12 and onwards with how the tuned Model ID impacts WCA's code recommendations. The process of building Ansible training data and tuning customized models for generative AI is potentially a complex and time-consuming one. For example, the model tuning employed in the steps ahead for the creation of an OpenShift cluster according to an enterprise organization's specific standards requires approximately 4 hours to train and generate a customized AI model. In preparation for model tuning, an organization or user can transform their existing Playbooks into training data for WCA using the open-source Ansible Parser Tool . The tool analyzes Ansible Playbooks and generates a single JSONL ( ftdata.jsonl formatted) file that can be uploaded to WCA's model tuning studio for developing customized AI models. The process of calibrating and running the Ansible Parser Tool is time-consuming and potentially complex, depending on the scope of Playbooks that an organization wishes to analyze and prepare for model tuning. This falls outside the scope of the hands-on material for this training. For the purposes of demonstration, a preconfigured openshift-tune-micro.jsonl was used for the model tuning example. With the Ansible training data prepared, the IBM watsonx Code Assistant on IBM Cloud service was configured to execute a new model tuning experiment. WCA provides a graphical user experience [A] to streamline the model tuning and customization process Tuning experiment name [B] set to Tuning Experiment and confirmed with Create tuning experiment [C] The openshift-tune-micro.jsonl training data from Ansible Parser Tool is uploaded into WCA [D] A summary of metrics\u2014 including parameters for sampling and Ansible modules \u2014are displayed within the model tuning wizard before Start tuning [E] is selected to kick off the model tuning operating After the tuning operation has ended, a training loss graph reveals how accurate the model's predictions are over the training data set, across multiple tuning cycles As the number of tuning cycles increase, the training loss rating will tend to decrease Model tuning for these particular metrics and parameters takes approximately 4 hours to complete CLICK TO EXPAND \u2014 ACCOMPANYING SCREENSHOTS To override the IBM Granite base model recommendations, you must provide a pointer to a customized Model ID (prepared and hosted earlier on WCA) using the VS Code extension. Model ID : 479b0ed4-5592-46a9-bdce-52ad38948070<|sepofid|>7d783e5e-ea77-4dc9-a684-a2257f4eac43 Look for Ansible under the Installed services in the Extensions panel. Click the Manage (\"cogwheel\") icon located just to the right of the Ansible tile From the drop-down options, click Extension Settings [A] Within the search bar at the top of the panel, add the text Model to filter the results [B] Copy and paste the Model ID value (above) into the empty Ansible > Lightspeed: Model ID Override field [C] , then click the X in the top-left corner of the panel to save and exit Extension Settings With the tuned model, WCA will recommend code using modules, functions, and other details specific to your organization's private IT environment. Return to the tuning-example.yml Playbook from Step 10 and delete the code recommendations generated in Step 11 Regenerate the code recommendations for the task by placing your cursor at the end of Line 6 , hitting Enter , and then Tab Observe how the tuned Model ID has modified WCA's code recommendations by toggling between the TUNED MODEL and STANDARD MODEL tabs below TUNED MODEL STANDARD MODEL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster register : cluster_create_output when : cluster_output.rc != 0 ibm.cloudcollection.ibm_container_cluster : name : test_cluster datacenter : \"{{ datacenter }}\" machine_type : \"{{ machine_type }}\" hardware : \"{{ hardware }}\" kube_version : 4.14_openshift public_vlan_id : \"{{ public_vlan_id }}\" private_vlan_id : \"{{ private_vlan_id }}\" default_pool_size : \"{{ default_worker_pool_size }}\" entitlement : \"{{ entitlement }}\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 --- - name : Deploy infrastructure hosts : all tasks : - name : Create an OpenShift cluster ansible.builtin.command : oadm create-cluster --wait=false --name=openshift-cluster register : oadm_create_cluster changed_when : \"'created' in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" failed_when : \"'already exists' not in oadm_create_cluster.stdout\" Using the tuned Model ID , WCA has returned a recommendation to use the ibm.cloudcollection.ibm_container_cluster Module for the IBM Cloud, instead of the standard ansible.builtin.command Module from Step 11 . This more accurately conforms to the organization's Ansible automation standards and requirements.

Generating Code with IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed An Ansible Task is a statement in Ansible's automation script (the YAML-based Playbooks you will be working with) that declares a single action to be executed. This might be installing a package, copying a file, or shutting down a service on a remote machine. Each Task represents an idempotent operation (an action that can be repeated multiple times and deliver the same result every time) that aligns the remote managed node to the specified state. Idempotent operations also ensure consistency across multiple executions, guaranteeing the same steps are taken on each execution of the task. At the time of publication, IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed ( WCA ) will only generate code for Ansible Tasks , including both single task and multi-task automation. After you have learned the fundamentals of generating Ansible Task code blocks, you'll be ready to shape and tailor the AI-generated code recommendations using WCA's model tuning capabilities. ii. Single task Ansible operations The process of creating AI-generated code recommendations is as simple as modifying the natural language (plain English) Task descriptions of an action that is to be executed, which always start with - name: and are followed by some description of the task to be performed. Ansible Tasks are often preceded with some # comments or documentation. After the natural language description of the automation Task has been set by the user, WCA handles the rest. WCA is also capable of generating multiple Ansible Tasks from more complex natural language descriptions\u2014 what is referred to as multi-task code generation \u2014which you will experiment with later in this module. However, to get started, let's begin with the basics of generating code for single task use cases. Begin by opening the install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook from the list of assets in the Explorer browser. Click the Explorer tab from the left-hand interface [A] Drill down into the Install and configure Cockpit using Ansible subdirectory [B] Double-click the install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook A replica of the Playbook code is also included below in the documentation The red highlighting within the editor reminds users that the tasks: section contains no valid -name: task definitions. This is part of WCA's code validation process which runs automatically and alerts users to syntax errors in their code. You can safely ignore these warnings for now, as you will be un-commenting and generating valid -name: task definitions in the following steps. ~/Documents/ansible-wca-demo-kit/install and configure Cockpit using Ansible/install_cockpit_single-task.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 --- - name : Install and configure Cockpit hosts : rhel become : true # module_defaults: # ansible.builtin.service: # enabled: true # state: started tasks : # TASK 1 # # 1a. Uncomment task description below and generate a task suggestion. # # Note - The suggestion included Ansible best practices by using Fully Qualified Collection name. # - name: Install cockpit package # TASK 2 # # 2a. Uncomment task description below and generate a task suggestion. # # Note - Ansible Lightspeed used \"ansible.builtin.template\" module based on the \".j2\" file extension. # # Note - The suggestion set the file permissions (\"0644\"), owner, and group based on Ansible best practices. # - name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit # TASK 3 # # 3a. Uncomment task description below and generate a task suggestion. # # Note - Ansible Lightspeed used the generic \"Start and enable service\" prompt # # and full Playbook context to infer the recommendation should start the \"cockpit\" service. # # 3b. Uncomment the \"module_defaults\" section at the top of the Playbook. # # 3c. Clear current task suggestion and request updated suggestion. # # Note - Ansible Lightspeed used the full Playbook context and evaluated the \"module_defaults\" # # when generating a suggestion. # # The updated suggestion no longer includes \"enabled:\" and \"state:\" arguments. # - name: Start and enable service # TASK 4 # # 4a. Uncomment task description below and generate an Ansible Playbook task suggestion. # # 4b. Save the Playbook. # - name: Wait 15 seconds port 9090 The install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook code above warrants some explanation before we move on with making AI-generated modifications to it: Line 2 essentially marks the beginning of the Playbook instructions, the purpose of which is to automate the process of installing and configuring Cockpit for Red Hat Ansible. Lines 3-4 define variables that will remain static throughout the remainder of the Playbook. These variables will be referenced by the AI-generated code suggestions at a later stage. This is a key capability of the offering and one which you will explore in much finer details later on in this module. Lines 6-9 are variables which have been commented out and therefore are invisible to the execution of the Ansible script and not examined by WCA for context when generating code recommendations. You will experiment with how removing the # comment blocks impacts the recommendations of task block code. \"Uncommenting\" these lines of code will make them viable for execution and these lines will afterwards be considered as valid Playbook \"context\" for AI code generation. Locate TASK 1 on Line 15 of the YAML file, which handles installation of Cockpit for Ansible. Cockpit is an interactive server administration interface that provides a graphical overview of statistics and configurations for a system or systems within a network. # - name: Install cockpit package Pay attention to the indentation and characters used on Line 15 , which in sequence from left to right are as follows: begins with Tab (or Space whitespaces) for indentation a # character to \"comment out\" the line contents a whitespace Space character - name: which signifies the start of a Task definition and finally the natural language description of the Task INDENTATION LEVELS AND WHITESPACE Similar to Python, Ansible and YAML-based Playbooks are very sensitive to whitespacing and indentation. Indentations (such as the Tab in this example) denote different hierarchies and code nesting levels within the YAML structure. You may use Space instead of Tab if you prefer, but be sure to use indentations consistently : choose to use either Tab or Space for indenting lines of code, and do not interchange between the two. To generate code for TASK 1 using WCA, first uncomment the line of code (remove # characters from the start of a line). Highlight the line(s) of code you wish to uncomment and then press Cmd + ? for macOS or Ctrl + ? for Windows You can repeat those keystrokes with the line(s) selected to toggle between commenting or uncommenting lines of code Tip: commented out lines of code in VS Code will appear as green text Afterwards, Line 15 should look like the following \u2014 beginning with a single Tab : - name : Install cockpit package Now you are ready to begin generating code. Place your cursor on Line 15 and hit Enter Wait for WCA to engage and generate the suggested (in grey, italicized text ) code block for executing the task This temporary code suggestion is entirely generated by AI As a user, you have the option to either: Accept the code recommendation as-given by pressing Tab Modify the recommended code by highlighting and replacing the italicized text FAILED TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / \"YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IBM WATSONX...\" This warning will occur when the Ansible plugin for VS Code needs to be re-authenticated with WCA. It can occur after an extended period of inactivity or a system restart. For example, if your lab environment is running inside a VM, pausing or restarting the VM may produce this error. To re-authenticate: Sign out from the VS Code application by clicking the User icon [A] in the bottom-left corner of the interface, hover over your username, and then click Sign Out [B] If you are running this environment inside a virtual machine (VM) , closing and restarting the VM will not resolve the issue \u2014 you must sign out from the VS Code application, not the VM Once logged out, follow from Step 7 of the Setup & Troubleshooting to re-authenticate with WCA CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible \"ANSIBLE-LINT IS NOT AVAILABLE.\" ansible-lint checks Playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved and can fix some of the most common ones for you. It will constantly check your Ansible syntax as you type and provide recommendations for how to improve it. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises If you wish to install ansible-lint on your local machine, execute the following instruction within a Terminal console: python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible-lint Hit Tab to accept the suggested code and then compare with the SOLUTION tab below. TEMPLATE SOLUTION # TASK 1 - name : Install cockpit package # TASK 1 - name : Install cockpit package ansible.builtin.package : name : cockpit state : present As part of the plain-text description of the Task, WCA was asked to include the cockpit Role, part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles Certified Content Collection. The AI-generated code suggestion invoked a Fully Qualified Collection Name ( FQCN ) - ansible.builtin.package Making use of FQCNs where possible is a recommended best practice and is a prime example of the many ways in which the offering infuses post-processing capabilities within the AI-generated code produced by WCA. Additional examples of infusing best-practices into AI-generated code recommendations can be found in TASK 2 ( Line 21 of the unmodified template or Line 25 after Step 5 ): Uncomment - name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit Hit Enter to generate the task code recommendation and accept the AI-suggested code (without modifications) by pressing Tab Compare your results with the SOLUTION tab below TEMPLATE SOLUTION # TASK 2 - name : Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit # TASK 2 - name : Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit ansible.builtin.template : src : cockpit.conf.j2 dest : /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf owner : root group : root mode : '0644' The AI-generated code recommendation will copy cockpit.conf to the target host. Take note of the fact that the recommendation included the mode: argument and set the Linux file permissions to 0644 , neither of which were things explicitly requested in the Task -name description, but are both additions which adhere to best practices around defining Ansible automaton tasks. Setting a file permission to 0644 specifies read and write permissions for User and Group levels within the Linux OS, and provides only read permissions to all others. iii. Multi-task Ansible operations Up to this point, we've kept a narrow aperture on AI-generated recommendations for single tasks \u2014 examining and experimenting with generating Ansible code task by task, one at a time. However, a powerful WCA feature is the ability to combine multiple task descriptions into a single natural language prompt; in turn, WCA is able to parse that instruction, decompose the instruction into discrete Ansible Task parts, and return a complete code recommendation for achieving the author's intended goal. Syntactically, multiple tasks are combined into a single natural language expression through the use of ampersand ( & ) characters. Simply write out all the automation task descriptions on a single line, separating each description with a & character. The line must also begin with a # character for reasons that will be explained shortly. To illustrate, let's look at a multi-task Ansible Playbook: install_cockpit_multi-task.yml The contents of this Playbook should look familiar to you already: it is essentially the same Playbook examined in Steps 1-6 ( install_cockpit_single-task.yml ), re-written in an equivalent multi-task expression Each of the Task descriptions from the previous Playbook have been consolidated into a single description on Line 12 , separated by & characters ~/Documents/ansible-wca-demo-kit/install and configure Cockpit using Ansible/install_cockpit_multi-task.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 --- - name : Install and configure Cockpit hosts : rhel become : true module_defaults : ansible.builtin.service : enabled : true state : started tasks : # Install cockpit package & Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit & Start and enable service & Wait 15 seconds port 9090 There are two crucial distinctions between single task and multi-task code generation: formatting and execution. Formatting : Notice that Line 12 does not begin with -name: , as was the case with single task descriptions Execution : In order to generate AI code recommendations for multi-task descriptions, Line 12 must stay commented out (the # needs to remain at the start of the line) What is the rationale behind this? When WCA's generative AI capabilities parse Line 12 , its output will include multiple -name: tasks, each containing potentially multiple lines of instructions, based on how many & -delineated task descriptions are included on the line. Therefore, the way in which the code generation step is executed on Line 12 is a consequence of the formatting decision. Execution of a code generation step on a commented-out ( # ) line containing & delineators is recognized by WCA as a unique case that will be acted upon as a multi-task statement. Place your cursor at the end of Line 12 , and without removing the # character, press Enter to execute the code generation step.

Idempotent operations also ensure consistency across multiple executions, guaranteeing the same steps are taken on each execution of the task. At the time of publication, IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed ( WCA ) will only generate code for Ansible Tasks , including both single task and multi-task automation.

Ansible Tasks are often preceded with some # comments or documentation. After the natural language description of the automation Task has been set by the user, WCA handles the rest. WCA is also capable of generating multiple Ansible Tasks from more complex natural language descriptions\u2014 what is referred to as multi-task code generation \u2014which you will experiment with later in this module. However, to get started, let's begin with the basics of generating code for single task use cases. Begin by opening the install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook from the list of assets in the Explorer browser. Click the Explorer tab from the left-hand interface [A] Drill down into the Install and configure Cockpit using Ansible subdirectory [B] Double-click the install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook A replica of the Playbook code is also included below in the documentation The red highlighting within the editor reminds users that the tasks: section contains no valid -name: task definitions. This is part of WCA's code validation process which runs automatically and alerts users to syntax errors in their code. You can safely ignore these warnings for now, as you will be un-commenting and generating valid -name: task definitions in the following steps. ~/Documents/ansible-wca-demo-kit/install and configure Cockpit using Ansible/install_cockpit_single-task.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 --- - name : Install and configure Cockpit hosts : rhel become : true # module_defaults: # ansible.builtin.service: # enabled: true # state: started tasks : # TASK 1 # # 1a.

Save the Playbook. # - name: Wait 15 seconds port 9090 The install_cockpit_single-task.yml Playbook code above warrants some explanation before we move on with making AI-generated modifications to it: Line 2 essentially marks the beginning of the Playbook instructions, the purpose of which is to automate the process of installing and configuring Cockpit for Red Hat Ansible. Lines 3-4 define variables that will remain static throughout the remainder of the Playbook. These variables will be referenced by the AI-generated code suggestions at a later stage. This is a key capability of the offering and one which you will explore in much finer details later on in this module. Lines 6-9 are variables which have been commented out and therefore are invisible to the execution of the Ansible script and not examined by WCA for context when generating code recommendations. You will experiment with how removing the # comment blocks impacts the recommendations of task block code. \"Uncommenting\" these lines of code will make them viable for execution and these lines will afterwards be considered as valid Playbook \"context\" for AI code generation. Locate TASK 1 on Line 15 of the YAML file, which handles installation of Cockpit for Ansible. Cockpit is an interactive server administration interface that provides a graphical overview of statistics and configurations for a system or systems within a network. # - name: Install cockpit package Pay attention to the indentation and characters used on Line 15 , which in sequence from left to right are as follows: begins with Tab (or Space whitespaces) for indentation a # character to \"comment out\" the line contents a whitespace Space character - name: which signifies the start of a Task definition and finally the natural language description of the Task INDENTATION LEVELS AND WHITESPACE Similar to Python, Ansible and YAML-based Playbooks are very sensitive to whitespacing and indentation. Indentations (such as the Tab in this example) denote different hierarchies and code nesting levels within the YAML structure. You may use Space instead of Tab if you prefer, but be sure to use indentations consistently : choose to use either Tab or Space for indenting lines of code, and do not interchange between the two. To generate code for TASK 1 using WCA, first uncomment the line of code (remove # characters from the start of a line). Highlight the line(s) of code you wish to uncomment and then press Cmd + ? for macOS or Ctrl + ? for Windows You can repeat those keystrokes with the line(s) selected to toggle between commenting or uncommenting lines of code Tip: commented out lines of code in VS Code will appear as green text Afterwards, Line 15 should look like the following \u2014 beginning with a single Tab : - name : Install cockpit package Now you are ready to begin generating code. Place your cursor on Line 15 and hit Enter Wait for WCA to engage and generate the suggested (in grey, italicized text ) code block for executing the task This temporary code suggestion is entirely generated by AI As a user, you have the option to either: Accept the code recommendation as-given by pressing Tab Modify the recommended code by highlighting and replacing the italicized text FAILED TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / \"YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IBM WATSONX...\" This warning will occur when the Ansible plugin for VS Code needs to be re-authenticated with WCA. It can occur after an extended period of inactivity or a system restart. For example, if your lab environment is running inside a VM, pausing or restarting the VM may produce this error. To re-authenticate: Sign out from the VS Code application by clicking the User icon [A] in the bottom-left corner of the interface, hover over your username, and then click Sign Out [B] If you are running this environment inside a virtual machine (VM) , closing and restarting the VM will not resolve the issue \u2014 you must sign out from the VS Code application, not the VM Once logged out, follow from Step 7 of the Setup & Troubleshooting to re-authenticate with WCA CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files.

The AI-generated code suggestion invoked a Fully Qualified Collection Name ( FQCN ) - ansible.builtin.package Making use of FQCNs where possible is a recommended best practice and is a prime example of the many ways in which the offering infuses post-processing capabilities within the AI-generated code produced by WCA. Additional examples of infusing best-practices into AI-generated code recommendations can be found in TASK 2 ( Line 21 of the unmodified template or Line 25 after Step 5 ): Uncomment - name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit Hit Enter to generate the task code recommendation and accept the AI-suggested code (without modifications) by pressing Tab Compare your results with the SOLUTION tab below TEMPLATE SOLUTION # TASK 2 - name : Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit # TASK 2 - name : Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit ansible.builtin.template : src : cockpit.conf.j2 dest : /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf owner : root group : root mode : '0644' The AI-generated code recommendation will copy cockpit.conf to the target host. Take note of the fact that the recommendation included the mode: argument and set the Linux file permissions to 0644 , neither of which were things explicitly requested in the Task -name description, but are both additions which adhere to best practices around defining Ansible automaton tasks. Setting a file permission to 0644 specifies read and write permissions for User and Group levels within the Linux OS, and provides only read permissions to all others.","title":"ii. Single task Ansible operations"},{"location":"generating/#iii-multi-task-ansible-operations","text":"Up to this point, we've kept a narrow aperture on AI-generated recommendations for single tasks \u2014 examining and experimenting with generating Ansible code task by task, one at a time. However, a powerful WCA feature is the ability to combine multiple task descriptions into a single natural language prompt; in turn, WCA is able to parse that instruction, decompose the instruction into discrete Ansible Task parts, and return a complete code recommendation for achieving the author's intended goal. Syntactically, multiple tasks are combined into a single natural language expression through the use of ampersand ( & ) characters. Simply write out all the automation task descriptions on a single line, separating each description with a & character. The line must also begin with a # character for reasons that will be explained shortly. To illustrate, let's look at a multi-task Ansible Playbook: install_cockpit_multi-task.yml The contents of this Playbook should look familiar to you already: it is essentially the same Playbook examined in Steps 1-6 ( install_cockpit_single-task.yml ), re-written in an equivalent multi-task expression Each of the Task descriptions from the previous Playbook have been consolidated into a single description on Line 12 , separated by & characters ~/Documents/ansible-wca-demo-kit/install and configure Cockpit using Ansible/install_cockpit_multi-task.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 --- - name : Install and configure Cockpit hosts : rhel become : true module_defaults : ansible.builtin.service : enabled : true state : started tasks : # Install cockpit package & Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit & Start and enable service & Wait 15 seconds port 9090 There are two crucial distinctions between single task and multi-task code generation: formatting and execution. Formatting : Notice that Line 12 does not begin with -name: , as was the case with single task descriptions Execution : In order to generate AI code recommendations for multi-task descriptions, Line 12 must stay commented out (the # needs to remain at the start of the line) What is the rationale behind this? When WCA's generative AI capabilities parse Line 12 , its output will include multiple -name: tasks, each containing potentially multiple lines of instructions, based on how many & -delineated task descriptions are included on the line. Therefore, the way in which the code generation step is executed on Line 12 is a consequence of the formatting decision. Execution of a code generation step on a commented-out ( # ) line containing & delineators is recognized by WCA as a unique case that will be acted upon as a multi-task statement. Place your cursor at the end of Line 12 , and without removing the # character, press Enter to execute the code generation step.

If you navigate to the My Reservations tab of the ITZ, you can monitor the progress of your reservation. Wait for the ITZ reservation to be marked as \"Ready\" before attempting to start the lab. ii. Accessing the VM Once the ITZ reservation has been marked as \"Ready\" , access connection details for the environment by either clicking the shortcut in the ITZ email or by drilling down into the My Reservations tab [A] on the ITZ web portal. Scroll down to the bottom of the reservation page and click the blue VM Remote Console button [A] to launch the VM interface. Select the techzone [A] login when prompted. Supply the following for the password: IBMDem0s! Hit Enter to complete the VM login Once you have successfully authenticated, click the Activities [A] button in the top-left corner of the interface to pull open the list of available applications from the bottom of the screen. Click the Visual Studio Code [B] application shortcut at the bottom of the desktop to start up the service. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation into the virtual machine (VM), it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. You may access the web browser at any time by clicking the Activities [A] button and then launching Firefox [C] , as shown. VS Code will load and then present you with an Authentication Required splash screen. Enter the same password [A] used to log into the VM: IBMDem0s! Click Unlock [B] iii. Authorizing VS Code with WCA Now you must authorize the VS Code environment for use with WCA, using the Red Hat account details that were generated for you in Steps 5-6 . Within your VS Code environment click the Ansible plugin [A] (denoted by the A logo) on the left-hand side of the interface. Two panels will open along the left side of the interface Within the Ansible Lightspeed Login panel, click the blue Connect button [B] The extension Ansible wants to sign in using Ansible Lightspeed : click Allow [C] Do you want Code to open the external website? : click Open [D] A web browser will load with the header Log in to Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant \u2014 this is where you will supply your registration details recorded in Step 6 in order to authenticate the VS Code plugin with WCA. Click the Log in with Red Hat button Provide the Username and Password recorded in Step 6 of this module Click Submit to continue When prompted for We need a little more information , set Job Role to Student Click the Submit button to finalize your account activation COPY AND PASTE INSTRUCTIONS INTO A VIRTUAL MACHINE As you are running the lab environment inside a virtual machine (VM), it is not possible to \"paste\" lab instructions or information from your local machine's clipboard directly into the VM. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. After logging in with Red Hat, the web browser will display the prompt to Authorize Ansible Lightspeed for VS Code . Click Authorize [A] Allow this site to open the vscode link with Visual Studio Code - URL Handler? : click Open URL At this stage, the Ansible extension for VS Code is now authenticated and connected to IBM watsonx Code Assistant . Verify [A] that the environment is logged in as your unique Username and that the User Type: Licensed A notification pop-up will also appear in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface confirming the successful login CLICK TO EXPAND \u2014 FAILURE TO LOGIN OR TIMED OUT If the authentication procedure in Steps 15-17 takes too long, activation of the plugin will be \"timed out\" and the VS Code environment will display an error message [B] in the bottom-right corner Click the Connect [C] button as shown and repeat Steps 15-17 as before; the login process should run smoother (and faster) on the second attempt iv. [OPTIONAL] Download demo assets to local machine If you wish to complete the hands-on lab using a local installation of VS Code (instead of using the provided Virtual Machine), you may do so - but you'll need to clone (download) the accompanying demo assets first. To do so, first install the GitHub CLI library. Execute the following command within a Terminal console to clone (via git ) the supporting demo assets repository ( ansible-wca-demo-kit.git ) to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/chetan-hireholi/ansible-wca-demo-kit Open the local ansible-wca-demo-kit folder within VS Code to access the demo assets for the remaining sections of the lab. v. Troubleshooting and support If you require assistance or run into issues with the hands-on lab, help is available. Environment issues: The lab environment is managed by IBM Technology Zone. Opening a support case ticket is recommended for issues related to the hands-on environment (provisioning, running, and so on.) Documentation issues: If there is an error in the lab documentation, or if you require additional support in completing the material, open a thread on the #wca-ansible-techzone-support Slack channel. Product questions: For questions related to IBM watsonx Code Assistant capabilities, sales opportunities, roadmap, and other such matters, open a thread on the #watsonx-code-assistant Slack channel. As you settle in to the environment and begin your training, you may encounter unexpected warnings or errors. Many of these can be safely ignored or can be easily rectified. This section will serve as a running list of frequently asked questions and troubleshooting techniques. Click on any of the following topics for additional details. FAILED TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / \"YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IBM WATSONX...\" This warning will occur when the Ansible plugin for VS Code needs to be re-authenticated with WCA. It can occur after an extended period of inactivity or a system restart. For example, if your lab environment is running inside a VM, pausing or restarting the VM may produce this error. To re-authenticate: Sign out from the VS Code application by clicking the User icon [A] in the bottom-left corner of the interface, hover over your username, and then click Sign Out [B] If you are running this environment inside a virtual machine (VM) , closing and restarting the VM will not resolve the issue \u2014 you must sign out from the VS Code application, not the VM Once logged out, follow from Step 7 of the Setup & Troubleshooting to re-authenticate with WCA CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible \"ANSIBLE-LINT IS NOT AVAILABLE.\" ansible-lint checks Playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved and can fix some of the most common ones for you. It will constantly check your Ansible syntax as you type and provide recommendations for how to improve it. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises If you wish to install ansible-lint on your local machine, execute the following instruction within a Terminal console: python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible-lint RED ANSIBLE ICON ALONG BOTTOM-RIGHT INTERFACE The Ansible extension for VS Code will check your local machine to determine if Red Hat Ansible has been installed locally. If you have not set up Ansible (the standalone version) on your local machine previously, this tile will display as red. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises. CANNOT SET PROPERTIES OF UNDEFINED (SETTING 'currentModelValue') Make sure that the Model ID Override field is set to empty in your Ansible for VS Code extension settings. To verify this: Click the Extensions tab [A] along the left-hand interface Click the Manage icon [B] on the right side of the Ansible extension tile, then drill down into Extension Settings [C] Add the text Model to the search filter [D] at the top of the Extension Settings panel Clear the input field [E] of any model IDs and leave it blank Close the Extension Settings panel by clicking X and return to the Ansible Playbook SPAWN C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe ENOENT This warning is not related to Ansible or WCA. You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises. PYTHON DRIVERS ARE MISSING The WCA extension for VS Code requires that Python drivers are included within the workspace. These are usually configured within VS Code by default, but can be easily set if necessary. Look for a Python tile adjacent to the Ansible tile along the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface. If it is not set, click the tile and select the Python 3.11.5 64-bit drivers. Click the gold-colored Select python environment button at the bottom-right of the interface From the console at the top of the VS Code environment, select the recommended Python 3.11.5 64-bit option and hit Enter to confirm GIT NOT INSTALLED If your machine has not used Git previously, you may be prompted by VS Code to install it before attempting a clone request. This is more commonplace on Windows operating systems, but some MacOS users may need to install Git as well. The following instructions will guide you through the process: With the VS Code application open, click the Source Control [A] tab from the left-hand interface and then click Download Git [B] . A web browser will open to the git-scm.com Downloads page. Download [C] the version recommended for your machine's particular operating system. The recommended version will be displayed first at the top of the list. Execute the installer on your machine and follow along with the prompts to finish installing Git. Accept the license agreement and accept the default values on each page. Return to VS Code and once again click the Source Control [D] tab, then click the blue Initialize Repository [E] button. From the top of the Source Control tab, click the three dots ... [F] icon to expand a drop-down menu of options. Click on the Clone [G] option. Follow the instructions for the remainder of this section to clone the ansible-wca-demo-kit repository to your local machine [H] . COPY AND PASTE INSTRUCTIONS INTO A VIRTUAL MACHINE As you are running the lab environment inside a virtual machine (VM), it is not be possible to \"paste\" lab instructions from your local machine's clipboard directly into the VM. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. vi.

You can safely ignore this error if it occurs during the lab exercises. PYTHON DRIVERS ARE MISSING The WCA extension for VS Code requires that Python drivers are included within the workspace. These are usually configured within VS Code by default, but can be easily set if necessary. Look for a Python tile adjacent to the Ansible tile along the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface. If it is not set, click the tile and select the Python 3.11.5 64-bit drivers. Click the gold-colored Select python environment button at the bottom-right of the interface From the console at the top of the VS Code environment, select the recommended Python 3.11.5 64-bit option and hit Enter to confirm GIT NOT INSTALLED If your machine has not used Git previously, you may be prompted by VS Code to install it before attempting a clone request. This is more commonplace on Windows operating systems, but some MacOS users may need to install Git as well. The following instructions will guide you through the process: With the VS Code application open, click the Source Control [A] tab from the left-hand interface and then click Download Git [B] . A web browser will open to the git-scm.com Downloads page. Download [C] the version recommended for your machine's particular operating system. The recommended version will be displayed first at the top of the list. Execute the installer on your machine and follow along with the prompts to finish installing Git. Accept the license agreement and accept the default values on each page. Return to VS Code and once again click the Source Control [D] tab, then click the blue Initialize Repository [E] button. From the top of the Source Control tab, click the three dots ... [F] icon to expand a drop-down menu of options. Click on the Clone [G] option.

Next steps"},{"location":"source-matching-post-processing/","text":"Christopher Bienko (Principal, IBM Global Sales Enablement) demonstrates key elements of the Content Source Matching and Post-Processing module. [10 min] i. Why code attribution and post-processing matters for generative AI At this point, you should now be well acquainted with Ansible Tasks and Playbooks . Ansible Playbooks are comprised of multiple Tasks \u2014 which you have been using IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed's ( WCA ) generative AI capabilities to define and expand upon. If a Playbook contains multiple \"tasks\" that together achieve some singular goal or purpose, you might want to group these tasks into a single reusable unit. For example, a string of \"tasks\" might provision infrastructure for separate development, test, and production clusters from a major cloud vendor. Patterns for automating endpoints from these vendors can be codified into Ansible Modules , which are supported by Red Hat and the Ansible community writ large. And finally, collections of Playbooks and Modules can be organized into \"blueprints\" for automation tasks that are frequently used together to achieve some goal; a goal which you might want to make repeatable or shareable with other teams within your business. These blueprints are referred to as Ansible Roles . They provide a structured way to organize tasks, templates, files, and variables, and are available to drop directly into Ansible Playbooks. Roles make it possible to easily manage and set up complex automation tasks, essentially providing a rubric to streamline automation projects. Collectively, these Playbooks, Modules, and Roles form a comprehensive ecosystem of business and community-driven support for patterning automation to work with the broadest range of vendors, technologies, and clouds. Ansible Galaxy is a Red Hat-curated, community-driven repository for Ansible Roles . Via communities such as Galaxy, thousands of Roles are available for Ansible users to leverage within their own Playbooks. Ansible Galaxy is also key to how generative AI code recommendations from WCA are attributed back to original content sources and authors. ii. Content source matching A powerful capability within WCA is Content Source Matching (often referred to as \"code explainability\"), which attempts to match AI-generated code suggestions to the training data and sources that were utilized in generating the suggested Task code. These code attribution suggestions are created using a k-NN ( K-Nearest Neighbors ) algorithm that examines Ansible Galaxy and training data repositories in search of the nearest related content to the AI-generated code suggestions. To enable Content Source Matching capabilities within WCA, navigate to the main menu bar for VS Code and drill down into View > Open View... [A] The console [A] along the top of the VS Code interface is now activated and awaiting a prompt. Type Lightspeed Training Matches and hit Enter to confirm the selection. After making this configuration change to VS Code, all requests for WCA to generate code recommendations will now open a panel at the bottom of the VS Code interface It is under the Ansible tab that content source matching results will be displayed Other tabs will also displayed for variety of options: Problems , Output , Debug Console , Terminal , and Ports Open the install_pgsql-single-task.yml Ansible Playbook, which is included within the ansible-wca-demo-kit directory. The full location of the Playbook, as well as the contents, are available in the code block below. ~/Documents/ansible-wca-demo-kit/install and configure PostgreSQL and PGAdmin container/install_pgsql-single-task.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 --- - name : Configure Database servers hosts : databases become : true tasks : # TASK 1 # - name: Install postgresql-server # TASK 2 # Ansible Lightspeed used an easy-to-understand natural language prompt and suggested the correct, more complex PostgreSQL CLI command to initiate the database. # Ansible Lightspeed used best practices and kept the task idempotent by including creates: /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf in the suggestion. # - name: Run postgresql setup command # TASK 3 # Ansible Lightspeed used natural language prompt and added state: started and enabled: true module arguments based on Start and enable... in the Ansible task description. # - name: Start and enable postgresql service Generate a code recommendation for the task on Line 8 by placing your cursor at the end of the line and hitting Enter . Pay attention to the code attribution details associated with this recommendation, which will be appearing under the Ansible tab at the bottom of the VS Code interface once the code recommendation is finalized. You will need to accept the AI-generated code suggestions (using the Tab key) before the Ansible content source matching tab will provide details about the code's origins. - name : Install postgresql-server ansible.builtin.package : name : postgresql-server state : present The three most likely content sources used in training the WCA model\u2014 which produced the AI-generated code recommendations \u2014are listed within the Ansible tab [A] . Recall from earlier that these code attribution suggestions are created using a k-NN algorithm that searches Ansible Galaxy repositories for the nearest related content to the AI-generated code suggestions. Clicking the arrow icon to the left of each attribution [B] will expand further details about the source. Information about the URL , Path , Data Source , License , Ansible Type , and Score are displayed (where available) under each listing. Red Hat-certified and maintained collections, as well as contributors to open source projects on Ansible Galaxy, are the primary sources for Ansible Lightspeed model training and are the content sources you are most likely to see matched to AI-generated code recommendations. Drilling down into the URL field will redirect your web browser back to the precise collections and sources on Ansible Galaxy from which the code recommendations were derived. Here you can learn much richer details about the status of the project, any associated open source repositories involved (such as GitHub), contributions and activities ongoing with the code base, the author(s) involved, and many more intricacies. iii. Post-processing capabilities Another element of code generation that WCA excels at is understanding context within the Playbook it is executing against. If a variable or attribute is defined earlier within that Playbook, it will be recalled and referenced\u2014 where it makes sense to do so \u2014in the generation of subsequent lines of code. You may have already noticed these post-processing capabilities in your experimentations with WCA-generated code suggestions. Post-processing of Task descriptions and YAML file contents helps generate contextually aware, accurate Ansible content suggestions. However, one way to make this feature quite obvious is to take a previously-generated block of Ansible Task code, update the value assigned to a named variable earlier in the Playbook, and then regenerate the Task code block. In theory, the newly-generated Task block will use the updated variable name (and differ from how the code block was originally generated). Create a New File... YAML Playbook named demo_provision_ec2_instance.yml anywhere within the /ansible-wca-demo-kit/ directory. You may save the Playbook in the root of the folder or any of the subdirectories Be sure to reference the expandable tooltips below for instructions on how to perform these operations and how to configure the Playbook language for use with WCA Copy and paste the following code block into the demo_provision_ec2_instance.yml Playbook and then save the file HOW TO CREATE NEW YAML PLAYBOOKS Note: You need to copy and paste the contents of the Playbook into a New File... within the same Lightspeed project directory that was used for the previous lab modules in order for the VS Code extension to engage. To create a new YAML Playbook within a VS Code environment: a. Copy the contents of the Playbook to clipboard using the button in the top-right corner of the lab guide code block. b. Return to your VS Code environment. In the top-left corner of the interface, with your Ansible Lightspeed folder selected, click the New File... button. c. Name the file to a description of your choosing, ending with .yml as the filetype. Set it to CustomPlaybook.yml , for example. Save it to one of the directories in the ansible-wca-demo-kit folder. d. Paste the clipboard contents into the YAML file and follow along with the suggestions below. COPY AND PASTE CODE WITHIN THE VM Information \"copied\" to your local machine's clipboard cannot be \"pasted\" directly into the virtual machine (VM) environment or VS Code. If you wish to copy and paste instructions directly from the lab documentation, it is recommended that you open the GitHub instructions inside the VM's web browser (Firefox). This will allow you to copy instructions to the VM's clipboard and paste instructions inside the VS Code editor. ANSIBLE LIGHTSPEED IS MISSING OR CODE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GENERATING Ansible Lightspeed and WCA will only generate code recommendations for Ansible Playbooks and YAML files. VS Code will typically auto-detect the programming language of the document you're working with, but on occassion you may need to manually specify the language. Even if working with a YAML file, you'll still need to specify the language mode as Ansible for the Lightspeed plugin to engage. To set the language mode correctly: In the bottom-right corner of the VS Code interface, hover over the Select Language Mode toggle [A] A console will appear at the top of VS Code with a drop-down list of options [B] Click Ansible from the suggested languages, or enter the text yourself and hit Enter Confirm that the Select Language Mode toggle in the bottom-right corner displays Ansible demo_provision_ec2_instance.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 --- - name : EC2 Cloud Operations hosts : localhost connection : local gather_facts : false module_defaults : group/aws : region : us-east-1 # vars: # ec2_instance: # name: lightspeed-instance-01 # key_name: lightspeed-keypair # image_id: ami-016eb5d644c333ccb # RHEL 9 us-east-1 # tags: # function: lightspeed-demo # security_group: secgroup-lightspeed tasks : # TASK 1 # # 1a.

Generate suggested code for TASK 1 ( Line 26 ) by placing the cursor at the end of the line, hitting Enter , and then confirming with Tab . Afterwards, perform the same steps to generate code for TASK 2 as well. The first round of WCA-generated code produces a code block [A] with a register: subnet_info ( Line 30 ), the result of which is to assign this VPC definition to a variable subnet_info . Nothing terribly complicated or surprising about that. The WCA-generated code that follows for the task on Line 38 (previously Line 33 in the raw template) recommends a code block [B] with vpc_subnet_id: \"{ { subnet_info.subnets[0].subnet_id } }\" as the value associated with the VPC's subnet ID. Critically, the variable subnet_info that was generated in the previous Task [A] is also referenced in the second Task. This demonstrates the contextual awareness of WCA in action. Change the name of variable subnet_info to subnet_name on Line 30 . Then delete the code block recommendations under Line 38 and regenerate the task. Notice that the new block [A] of TASK 2 now references the variable subnet_name that was modified just a moment ago in TASK 1 WCA has generated code for TASK 2 that takes into account the modified context and variables from TASK 1 of the Playbook Continue experimenting with WCA's contextual awareness and post-processing capabilities. Try adjusting other variables within the Playbook and study how these modifications impact the generation of later blocks of Task code within the Playbook. iv.
