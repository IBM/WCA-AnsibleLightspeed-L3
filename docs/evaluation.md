# Evaluation Criteria for IBM Technical Sellers and Business Partners
#

To receive a Level 3 badge (*Generative AI for Code with watsonx Code Assistant Technical Sales Intermediate*), IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 skills requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated —differs depending on job role.

!!! note "IBM TECHNICAL SELLERS"
        
        IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a **Stand & Deliver** presentation, which will be uploaded to the IBM Stand & Deliver platform for evaluation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera.
        
        IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab.

!!! tip "BUSINESS PARTNERS"

        Business partners must pass a **skills evaluation quiz** after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Participants must pass the quiz with a grade of 80% or higher.

        The quiz questions will ask you about on-screen text or descriptions that come up as you work through the lab guide. Answers to quiz questions can only be determined by carefully following the instructions of the hands-on lab.

Take note that any materials marked as `OPTIONAL` are **not** evaluated for Level 3 badges.
        
- IBM technical sellers are *not* required to include optional sections in their Stand & Deliver
        
- Business partners are *not* tested on the contents of optional sections
